# **Plawnet**  

##  **Inspiration**  
Plawnet was inspired by the need for **sustainable and responsible consumption and production**. Many eco-friendly products are expensive, making it harder for people to make better choices. We wanted to create an **affordable, accessible platform** that encourages responsible consumption while supporting people with sustainable businesses.  

##  **What It Does**  
Plawnet is an **e-commerce platform** designed to make sustainable shopping **affordable and accessible**. It connects buyers and sellers of **eco-friendly products** at lower prices, promoting responsible consumption and reducing environmental waste while also focusing on sustainability and providing a **side hustle** for people.  

### **Plawnet Aligns With These UNSDG Goals:**  
- **Goal 11: Sustainable Cities & Communities** – Promotes eco-conscious urban living.  
- **Goal 12: Responsible Consumption & Production** – Reduces waste and encourages ethical shopping.  
- **Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth** – Helps people economically by providing side hustle opportunities.  

##  **Key Features**  
- **Buy & Sell Sustainable Products** – Users can list and purchase verified eco-friendly items.  
- **Home Page** – Displays recently listed products.  
- **Collections** – Allows users to browse, filter, and sort items based on price.  

##  **How was It Built**  
- **Frontend:** React.js for a dynamic and responsive UI, with CSS for styling.  
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js for handling API requests.  
- **Database:** MongoDB for product listings and user data.  

##  **Challenges We Ran Into**  
- **Tailwind CSS Issues** – We initially installed **Tailwind v4**, which wasn’t compatible with React. Even after downgrading to v3, we faced **plugin and dependency errors**. Eventually, we switched to **CSS** for styling.  
- **Time Constraints** – Developing a functional MVP within the hackathon timeframe.  
- **User Experience Optimization** – Ensuring a smooth, intuitive, and secure marketplace.  
- **Prototype Change** – Initially, we planned a **game development project** and even designed characters and maps. However, due to time constraints and a lack of experience in game development, we pivoted to a **web application**, which cost us valuable time.  

##  **Accomplishments That We're Proud Of**  
- Successfully built a **working web app** within the hackathon’s time limit.  
- Learned more about the **React framework** and worked effectively under pressure.  

##  **What We Learned**  
- The importance of **user trust** in sustainability claims.  
- How **pricing strategies** influence consumer behavior toward eco-friendly products.  
- The role of **technology in driving sustainability** through AI and data tracking.  
- **Time management & teamwork** in a high-pressure hackathon environment.  
- Deeper understanding of the **MERN stack**.  

##  **What's Next for Plawnet?**  
- **Admin Panel** – Allow sellers to sign up and list products directly.  
- **Expand Product Verification** – Integrate APIs to verify sustainability claims.  
- **Seller Ratings** – A trust-based system to highlight ethical businesses.  
- **Mobile App Development** – A dedicated app for seamless access.  
- **Eco-Brand Partnerships** – Collaborate with sustainable brands to offer exclusive deals.  
- **Gamification & Rewards** – Introduce incentives for sustainable purchases.
